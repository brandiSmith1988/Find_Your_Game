                    bored with the types of games you have been playing and are ready to try out a new level 
                    of difficulty, or perhaps you are quite experienced with plaformers and want to find another 
                    great edition to your list of achievements. Then, let us introduce you to a few options that 
                    just may be what you are looking for.

                     <p><br>The world of Super Mario brings yet another great addition to its list of titles, set in the Flower
                        Kingdom, Super Mario Bros: Wonder follows our original protagonists and a few extra familiar faces. With 
                        Princess Peach and Daisy tagging along for the adventure, Mario and Luigi have a little extra help facing
                        against the perils of their journey. A few new modes have been added and a couple of powerups are a little
                        different. There are eight worlds like with many of the previous Mario titles and the game is returning to 
                        the way of the side scrolling platformer we all know and love.

                   <p><br>Take to the skies in Vernal Edge, a spunky adventure that gives the feeling of your classic late 80's and 90's 
                      era side scrolling platformer games. With the Metroidvania pixelated style and quick moving mechanics, this game 
                      will definitely hit the nostalgia button. You follow an irate sword wielding girl named Vernal on a mission to put an end to her father, 
                      a tyrant named Asphodel. This game is set in a kingdom called Haricot, a world full of floating continents. Team up
                      with Vernal and an amnesiac robot, while trying to survive the onslaught together.
