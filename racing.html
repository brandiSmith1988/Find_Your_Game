                    Racing games are great for competing against other individuals or just pitting yourself against the Ai ran vehicles. One thing is for certain when it comes to racing games, you are going to find yourself becoming more and more competitive with each race. Some racing games are highly realistic like Forza or Nascar, but there are others like Mario Kart that are just silly and fun. If you like putting the pedal to the metal and a fierce competition, then racing games may be just what you are looking for.
